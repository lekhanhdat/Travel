    "name": "My Son Sanctuary",
    "description": "The My Son Sanctuary (also known as the Holy Land of My Son) is a complex of ancient Cham Pa temple ruins located in a secluded valley in My Son village, Thu Bon commune, Da Nang city. This site preserves over 70 architectural structures built over many centuries (from the 4th to the 13th century) with distinctive historical, cultural, architectural, and artistic values. The My Son Sanctuary is likened to a priceless museum of Cham Pa architecture and sculpture, vividly reflecting the remnants of the brilliant Champa civilization.\n\nCULTURAL HISTORY\nMy Son was established in the 4th century during the reign of King Bhadravarman, when the My Son valley was chosen as the holy city – an important religious and spiritual center of the ancient Champa Kingdom. Located to the west of the capital Simhapura (Tra Kieu) and near the ancient port town of Hoi An, this sanctuary is nestled among majestic mountains and forests, closely associated with a sacred stream flowing into the Thu Bon River. From the very beginning, My Son became the site where Cham kings built temples to perform rituals, offer sacrifices to deities, establish the legitimacy of their reign, and commemorate their victories. The temples here primarily worship the god Shiva under the symbol of Linga – the supreme patron deity of the Champa kingdom. For nearly a millennium, My Son was continuously restored and expanded by various Champa dynasties. The first wooden temple was destroyed by fire in the 6th century but was restored by King Sambhuvarman in the 7th century; thereafter, each Cham king upon ascending the throne would either construct new temples or renovate the old ones that had fallen into disrepair. Thus, the My Son Sanctuary increasingly developed, becoming the most important religious center of the entire kingdom. There was a period when My Son faded into obscurity (8th–9th century) as the dynasty moved its capital and established a new sanctuary in Nha Trang (Po Nagar), but by the early 10th century, the worship of Shiva was revived, and My Son was restored with a series of new temples built. By the 11th century, wars with neighboring regions severely damaged the My Son temples, but the Cham king later ordered repairs and restoration of many structures. Construction and restoration at My Son continued until the 13th century – King Jaya Paramesvaravarman II (1234) is considered the last king to have contributed to the restoration of this sanctuary. After the 13th century, historical records no longer mention the construction of temples at My Son, marking the end of nearly a millennium of continuous development of the sanctuary. Throughout this long journey, My Son has marked the brilliant development of Champa culture and art, preserving within it many unique architectural styles through various historical periods.\n\nARCHITECTURAL ART\nIn terms of planning, My Son's architecture is unique and rare in the form of a sanctuary complex consisting of multiple clusters of towers. The temples are arranged in groups, with each group typically having a main temple (Kalan) at the center and surrounding subsidiary towers, enclosed by thick brick walls. The main entrance of most main towers faces east (towards the sun god); some larger main towers also have additional side entrances facing north. In front of the main temple, there is usually a small gate tower (Gopura) with two interconnecting doors (one facing east, one leading into the main temple), followed by a long house (Mandapa) – with a tiled roof and spacious area – used for welcoming pilgrims, offering gifts, and organizing ritual dances dedicated to the deities. Surrounding the main temple are subsidiary towers and smaller architectural structures, creating a harmonious whole in terms of rituals and the sacred space of the Cham people. The My Son temples are all official religious architectural works, continuously built by Cham kings from the 4th to the 13th century. Therefore, each temple embodies the most refined and representative elements of contemporary Cham architectural art. Most of the identified architectural styles of Champa are present at My Son, and the temples here have established the foundational criteria for classifying Cham artistic styles. In other words, My Son is a living museum of Cham architecture, containing unique sculptures and decorative motifs that reflect the pinnacle of the intellect and craftsmanship of the ancient Cham people.\n\nNATURAL LANDSCAPE\nThe My Son Sanctuary is located amidst a pristine and majestic natural landscape, surrounded by dense mountains and forests, creating a profoundly spiritual atmosphere. Prominently to the south of the valley is the sacred Mahaparvata mountain (approximately 730m high), mentioned in inscriptions from the 4th century. According to the symbolic beliefs of the Cham people, this mountain is likened to a giant Linga of the god Shiva, while the My Son valley represents Yoni – the combination that creates the pair of cosmic symbols of sexual organs right within the heart of the heritage. A sacred stream flows through the valley, connecting to the Thu Bon River (Sanskrit: Mahadani – the embodiment of the goddess Ganga, wife of Shiva), providing fresh water year-round for purification rituals during Hindu festivals. The forest ecosystem in the My Son conservation area is also very diverse, preserving many precious species of flora and fauna such as various types of rosewood, ebony, red oak, cajeput, and wildlife like pheasants, flying lizards, wild boars, and large deer. The harmonious natural landscape with the cultural and spiritual space adds to the mysterious and sacred beauty of My Son, highlighting the value of the site amid the Central Highlands.\n\nOUTSTANDING VALUES\nWith its rich history and unique artistry, My Son is a typical testament to the ancient Champa civilization. The temples here reflect profound cultural exchanges: initially influenced by pure Hinduism, later combining with indigenous beliefs, and ultimately integrating into a distinct Champa identity. In terms of architecture and sculpture, My Son gathers the most representative essences of Cham art over nearly a millennium, creating an invaluable heritage complex of global significance. Many scholars evaluate that My Son can be compared to other famous temple complexes in the region such as Angkor Wat (Cambodia), Bagan (Myanmar), or Borobudur (Indonesia) in both scale and cultural artistic value. Thanks to these outstanding global values, My Son has been recognized by the world, becoming a source of pride for Vietnam's heritage on the global cultural map.\n\nTICKET PRICES\nAccording to information from the My Son Heritage Management Board, the entrance fee to the heritage site (including admission and service fees) is currently applied as follows: \nInternational visitors: 150,000 VND/person/visit (including admission and service fees). \nVietnamese visitors: 100,000 VND/person/visit (including admission and service fees).\n\nIDEAL TIME TO VISIT AND SOME NOTES\nMy Son is located in a tropical monsoon climate with two distinct seasons. The rainy season (from around September to January of the following year) often has heavy rains, slippery roads, and the valley may flood, making it difficult for sightseeing. In contrast, the dry season (from February to August) has less rain, is drier, and is more convenient for visitors. Among these, the period from February to April is considered the most ideal time to visit My Son, when the weather is pleasantly cool and the mountainous landscape is lush and green in spring, providing visitors with a complete sightseeing experience. Additionally, visitors should go early in the morning to avoid the harsh midday sun in summer and enjoy the fresh air, admiring the mystical My Son in the morning light.\n\nNOTES FOR VISITORS\nWhen visiting the My Son heritage site, visitors should pay attention to some regulations and behaviors to protect the site and preserve the sacred cultural space: \n- Comply with the regulations of the Management Board; pay attention to directional signs and follow the rules at the heritage site. \n- Behave civilly and politely: maintain general order, speak softly, and be friendly with everyone, showing respect for the heritage. \n- Wear appropriate clothing: dress neatly, respectfully, and solemnly when entering the temple area (avoid inappropriate or offensive attire). \n- Do not harm the heritage: absolutely do not touch, climb, or carve on brick walls, stone inscriptions, trees, or any architecture within the temple area. \n- Maintain cleanliness and the landscape: be environmentally conscious, do not litter; preserve cultural and architectural works and the natural landscape of the heritage. \n- Do not perform superstitious rituals: do not arbitrarily organize offerings, sacrifices, or activities contrary to local customs at the heritage site. \nFollowing these notes will help visitors have a meaningful and safe visit while contributing to the protection of this valuable cultural heritage of humanity – the My Son Sanctuary, so that the value of the site can be passed down to future generations. In recognition of these outstanding values, on December 4, 1999, My Son was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nReferences: \n1.

    "name": "Cu Lao Cham Biosphere Reserve – Hoi An",
    "description": "The Cu Lao Cham World Biosphere Reserve – Hoi An has the mission of conserving and developing coastal and marine resources for the Central Coast region of Vietnam. CU LAO CHAM WORLD BIOSPHERE RESERVE – HOI AN On May 26, 2009, at Jeju Island, South Korea, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized Cu Lao Cham – Hoi An as a world biosphere reserve*. The biosphere is a part of the Earth formed by three closely interconnected spheres: the lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere, which contain living matter and the products created by them. The upper limit of the biosphere is the thickest part of the ozone layer (about 25 km), the lower limit is the deepest part of the ocean floor (about 11 km), and the lower limit of the weathered crust. The Cu Lao Cham World Biosphere Reserve – Hoi An has a total area of 33,737 hectares, including the entire land area of Hoi An city and the sea area defined from the boundary points of the Cu Lao Cham Marine Protected Area connected to the boundary points on land in Hoi An, with three functional zones: core zone, buffer zone, and transition zone. Core Zone: Includes all the islands and functional areas (strictly protected area, ecological restoration area, development area, and rational exploitation area) within the Cu Lao Cham Marine Protected Area. The core zone covers an area of 11,560 hectares and primarily performs the conservation function of the Cu Lao Cham – Hoi An World Biosphere Reserve through the activities of the Marine Protected Area and the Cu Lao Cham special-use forest conservation force. Buffer Zone: Includes the sea surrounding the core zone along with the entire system of rivers, canals, natural ponds, natural wetlands, and beaches belonging to Hoi An city, covering an area of 20,660 hectares. This area concentrates important ecosystems that interact closely with the core zone, including: sea, rivers, wetlands, mangrove forests, tidal flats, beaches, sand dunes, river mouths, etc. The buffer zone plays a very important role in controlling water quality before it reaches the sea and in the ecological linkage between the mainland and the ocean. Transition Zone: This is the remaining part of Hoi An city, covering an area of 1,517 hectares, prominently featuring the Hoi An Ancient Town – a World Cultural Heritage site, and traditional craft villages that reflect the interaction between humans and nature. HIGHLIGHTED ATTRACTIONS Beaches at Cu Lao Cham: Cu Lao Cham has many beautiful beaches such as Ong Beach, Chong Beach, Lang Beach, and Xep Beach. Among them, Ong Beach is a favorite stop for tourists, where there are restaurants, fresh water bathing services, and a starting point for water sports activities such as snorkeling. Lang Beach and Huong Beach are quiet beaches, ideal for relaxation and leisure. In addition to the stunning beaches, Cu Lao Cham also boasts many other attractive destinations for those who wish to delve deeper into the culture, history, and nature of the island. Visitors can visit Tan Hiep Market, where you will find local specialties, or explore the Cu Lao Cham Marine Conservation Center to learn about the rich biodiversity of the area. One of the other interesting attractions is the Heritage Banyan Tree, a natural symbol associated with the history and culture of the island.

Speedboats are the most popular and fastest means of transport, with a travel time of only about 15-20 minutes from Cua Dai Port (Hoi An) or other boat docks. This means of transport is favored by many tourists due to its convenience and speed. Wooden boats are also an alternative, but the travel time will be longer, about 90 minutes. Wooden boats mainly serve local residents and group trips. * In addition to the ticket prices for speedboats or wooden boats, visitors should note some fees such as the entrance fee to Cu Lao Cham of 70,000 VND/person and environmental and security protection fees of 20,000 VND/person. Children under 12 months are free, while children from 1 to under 8 years old receive a 50% discount on adult ticket prices. SUGGESTED ITINERARY IDEAL TIME: Cu Lao Cham is known for its stunning natural scenery, from pristine white sandy beaches to lush primary forests and rich marine ecosystems. The ideal time to visit Cu Lao Cham is from March to August, when the weather is stable, the sea is calm, and the sky is clear. Boats operate vigorously during this time, making it easy for tourists to travel to the island; however, from September to February of the following year, although Cu Lao Cham still welcomes visitors, this is the rainy and stormy season in the Central region. At this time, high waves and unstable weather can affect transportation, especially for boats. However, if you want to experience the pristine beauty of the island during this time, be prepared for possible interrupted trips and ensure to monitor weather forecasts for the best preparation. Tourist services such as speedboats or boats may not operate continuously due to rough sea conditions.

    "name": "Dien Hai Fortress",
    "description": "Dien Hai Fortress (also known as Dien Hai Citadel or Fort de l'Ouest) is located in the center of the city, on the west bank of the Han River, now belonging to Hai Chau Ward, Da Nang City (formerly Thach Thang Ward, Hai Chau District, Da Nang City). In the 19th century, Da Nang was the gateway to the imperial city of Hue and the most important seaport in Central Vietnam. However, as early as the 16th century, Da Nang port had attracted the attention of Western merchant ships. Therefore, according to the regulations of the Hue court, Da Nang port was the only gateway for trade with the outside world, both to control foreign ships and to prevent foreign interference in the capital. Given the strategic importance of Da Nang's trading port, when he ascended the throne in 1802, King Gia Long (Nguyen Dynasty) organized the defense of this area by constructing many fortifications on the Son Tra Peninsula and along both banks of the Han River. Besides Dien Hai Fortress, An Hai, Trấn Dương Thất Bảo, and other fortifications such as My Thi, Hai Chau, Lien Tri, Phuoc Ninh, Hoa Khue were built, but the most significant was Dien Hai Fortress.\n\nSTRUCTURE OF DIEN HAI FORTRESS AS DESCRIBED IN DOCUMENTS\nDien Hai Fortress is located on the left bank of the Han River's west side, hence the French called it Fort de l'Ouest. Initially, it was built of earth by King Gia Long in 1813, thus it was called Bao Dien Hai, located near the sea and prone to damage. By 1823, King Minh Mang ordered it to be rebuilt with bricks, hence it was named Dien Hai Fortress and moved further inland, situated in the Trém area of Thach Thang village (as it is today) for safety, with Thai Tuong Nguyen Van Thanh in charge of construction. The fortress was built in the Vauban style, designed by French engineer Olivier Puymanel (who had previously collaborated with Ba Da Loc to assist Gia Long). It has a square shape with four protruding corners, a height of over 5m, a perimeter of 556m, deep moats over 3m, and two gates: one facing east towards the Han River and one facing south (the main gate). The fortress has two layers of walls, separated by a deep moat, with the outer wall being taller than the inner wall. Inside the outer wall, there were residences for generals and soldiers, as well as gunpowder storage, ammunition and weapon storage, food storage, a cannon foundry, and a repair workshop for damaged guns, along with a royal pavilion. During this period, Dien Hai Fortress was one of the most important defensive structures in Da Nang, alongside An Hai fortress on the opposite bank of the Han River, controlling the entry and exit of ships at Da Nang's seaport.\n\nDIEN HAI FORTRESS AFTER LIBERATION IN 1975 UNTIL 2004\nOn February 4, 1976, Quang Nam - Da Nang Province decided to establish Quang Nam - Da Nang Pharmaceutical Enterprise based on the merger of three pharmaceutical workshops: Quang Da, Quang Nam, and Area V located at Dien Hai Fortress. Officially operational on April 10, 1976, the enterprise made preliminary renovations to suit the initial production conditions of the unit, while the western wall was severely eroded due to encroachment by nearby houses. By 1977, to develop pharmaceutical production to meet increasing demand and export some products to the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries, Quang Nam - Da Nang Pharmaceutical Enterprise began to renovate the unit: constructing several single-story buildings at the front as an administrative area and finished goods warehouse, while also building a system of iron frame warehouses from Czechoslovakia on the west side of the vacant land outside the fortress. In 1985, the enterprise expanded production and removed two iron frame buildings on either side to construct two new three-story buildings, while also renovating the old buildings left by the French. On November 10, 2004, the Da Nang People's Committee approved a master plan to restore the Dien Hai Fortress site and its landscape components to serve visitors and tourists. The Central Pharmaceutical Enterprise 5 relocated to another location in Thanh Khe Ward.\n\nCURRENT STATUS OF DIEN HAI FORTRESS\nAfter 2004, Da Nang City decided to invest in the restoration and enhancement of Dien Hai Fortress with funding from the national cultural target program and the city, reconstructing the entire protruding wall on the northwest side, restoring the walls on the north and east sides, and reconstructing the gate and moat on the south side. Additionally, the Da Nang Museum was constructed on Dien Hai Fortress, with 172.5 m2 of collapsed wall being rebuilt and 1,800 m3 of earth being dredged from filled moats. During the construction process, several remaining cannons were discovered. In 2010, the Da Nang Museum officially opened to welcome visitors. The museum has also displayed the cannons found at Dien Hai Fortress in front of the museum. Over the years, the southern wall and gate, as well as the eastern wall and part of the northern wall, have been restored, while the western wall and moat adjacent to the residential area have not yet been restored. Recently, the Da Nang People's Committee has initiated the relocation of households on the west side of Dien Hai Fortress to restore the original condition of the site, aiming to fully restore and enhance the entire Dien Hai Fortress site in the coming years. With its special values, the historical site of Dien Hai Fortress has been classified as a special national relic by the Prime Minister in Decision No. 2082/QĐ-TTg dated December 25, 2017. \n\nReferences: Cultural Heritage Department - Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism: https://dsvh.gov.vn DA NANG CITY TOURISM PROMOTION CENTER",

    "name": "The archaeological site and artistic architecture of Dong Duong Buddhist Monastery.",
    "description": "The archaeological site and artistic architecture of Dong Duong Buddhist Monastery (Dong Duong Monastery Ruins) is located in Dong Duong village, Binh Dinh Bac commune, Thang Binh district, Quang Nam province, now part of Dong Duong commune, Da Nang city. The book \"Dai Nam Nhat Thong Chi\" from the Nguyen dynasty states, “Le Duong district has two towers in Dong Duong village. These two towers are about fifteen trượng apart, one is four trượng high, built of brick, with an octagonal shape on top and a square base, each side measuring one trượng. Four trượng away, there is an old foundation…”. Dong Duong Monastery became widely known only when French scientists published their research and excavation results. According to the inscription found at Dong Duong, in 875, King Indravarman II commissioned the construction of a Buddhist monastery and a temple dedicated to the Bodhisattva who protected the dynasty, Laskmindra Lokesvara Svabhyada. The Mahayana Buddhist nature is clearly reflected in the content of the inscriptions as well as the sculptures at Dong Duong. During the reign of Indravarman II, the capital of the Champa kingdom was moved from the Panduranga region back to the Amaravati region, renamed Indrapura. Some researchers believe that the site of the Indrapura capital is the area of Dong Duong village today. The capital was situated entirely within the Dong Duong field, approximately 2 km² (according to interpretations by French researchers, Dong Duong means \"sacred field.\" The term \"Duong\" is a phonetic variation of \"Yan\" - heaven, sacred in Cham language). It is a rectangular valley surrounded on three sides by high hills and mountains. To the north is the Ly Ly river, the gateway to the outside world, which is very discreetly arranged. The inscription also records the king's devotion, stating that in 875, “Due to his faith in Buddhism, the king had a monastery (Vihara) and a temple for Laksmindra Lokesvara Svabhayada constructed. The inscription also mentions the pure land (svargapura) or “liberation city” (moksapura), where the Buddha resides (Buddhapada). The king emphasized that those who commit crimes must suffer punishment in hell. After the construction was completed, the king also donated many lands, money, slaves, and many other things to Lokesvara. The king instructed that after his death, he would be renamed Paramabuddhaloka. All these events prove that King Indravarman II identified with the Buddha in the form of a Bodhisattva. The Champa Buddhism during this period followed the Mahayana tradition. Dong Duong Monastery was a famous Buddhist center not only of the ancient Champa kingdom but also of the entire Southeast Asia during the medieval period. It is considered a Buddhist sanctuary due to the massive scale of the remaining architectural relics and its cultural influence on the surrounding areas. The site has been heavily damaged by nature and war; today, only a section of the tower wall, commonly referred to by locals as the Bright Tower, remains, along with the foundations of architectural structures and some architectural decorations. In 1901, French researcher L. Finot conducted excavations at the monastery and subsequently published his findings on the Dong Duong relics, introducing 229 artifacts discovered, the most notable being a bronze Buddha statue – over 1 meter tall, regarded as a perfect and beautiful piece of art among the best in Southeast Asia. The Dong Duong bronze Buddha statue is currently housed at the Ho Chi Minh City Museum of History, recognized by the government as a \"national treasure\" in Decision No. 1426/QĐ-TTg, signed by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Thien Nhan on October 1, 2012, acknowledging 30 national treasures in the first batch. In 1902, H. Parmentier conducted large-scale excavations, attracting researchers to assess it as one of the important relics of Champa, and Dong Duong Monastery was truly recognized for its scale and significance when scientists published their research results. At that time, H. Parmentier discovered the main architecture of this sanctuary along with many valuable sculptures. According to his description, the entire main temple area and the surrounding towers were distributed along an axis from west to east, approximately 1,300 meters long. Additionally, a system of brick foundations of a monk's quarters and lecture halls connected over a vast perimeter was discovered, with tiles found that suggest a construction structure including a main hall for worship, a monk's quarters for monks to reside and study, and lecture halls for teachings. It can be said that this is an ideal closed model of a monastery for training monks. In September 1996, the Vietnam Archaeological Institute, the National University of Hanoi, and the Quang Nam – Da Nang Museum collaborated to survey Dong Duong village. Archaeologists found that, besides the architectural remnants of the monastery, there were not many traces of human habitation during the Champa kingdom period in Dong Duong village. The climate in Dong Duong village is very harsh, with barren land, and the layer of arable soil is only about 40 – 50 cm thick, with some areas only 20 cm thick, beneath which is a layer of laterite, making it not a convenient place to build a capital. It can be said that Dong Duong is purely a Buddhist sanctuary of the Champa kingdom, while the capital Indrapura must be a larger area, located outside the Dong Duong Monastery complex. The Dong Duong relics are a large architectural complex of a monastery (vihara) comprising many temple-tower combinations. The monastery is a large architectural ensemble enclosed within a rectangular outer wall, with a long side running in the main east-west direction measuring approximately 155m x 326m. The remaining foundation traces indicate that this is a quite large and high outer wall. The outer wall contains three architectural clusters aligned east-west and three large artificial lakes. There are two lakes in the northeast corner and one in the southeast corner. Today, one has been filled in to make farmland. Additionally, the southeast corner of the outer wall has traces of a long building. The outer wall has two gates, east and west. Currently, the gate remains very faint. Inside the outer wall is the inner wall. The inner wall encloses the central temple, which includes the main tower. The inner wall also has a special tower called the Well Tower, located in the southwest corner of the inner wall, which is now buried. + The main temple area is located in a rectangular area, 326m long and 155m wide, surrounded by brick walls. From the main temple area, there is a long path of about 760m leading east to a rectangular valley. The main temple area consists of three architectural groups extending along the east-west axis, separated by walls built of brick. + The eastern group only has the foundation traces of a long house, which researchers believe to be a Buddhist monastery (Vihara). This long house has a rectangular floor plan with two parallel rows of columns running east-west, each row having 8 brick columns, with a wooden frame roof and tiled covering. In this area, there is a large sandstone altar, intricately carved with many human figures and delicate patterns. + The middle group only has traces of wall bases and steps of a long house along the east-west axis. This house has relatively thin brick walls, with entrances at both ends, and many windows on the two walls, covered with tiles. Here, there are four large Dvarapala statues, about 2m tall, which researchers believe are impressive works in Cham sculpture art. The Dong Duong altar is currently displayed at the Da Nang Cham Sculpture Museum. This altar was found at the main tower area to the west, believed to be dedicated to the Bodhisattva Lakshmindra Lokeshvara – the main deity of the monastery. + The western group includes the main temples and surrounding auxiliary towers, which belong to the traditional tower type of Cham architecture; with a quadrilateral floor plan, the entrance facing east, and a fairly long front porch, with wall pillars decorated with dense and twisted leaf patterns, resembling a deep cow track, which is a characteristic pattern of the Dong Duong style. Around the base of the tower, there are decorations of elephant heads and miniature towers interspersed. Inside the temple, there is a large sandstone altar, carved with patterns resembling deep cow tracks, scenes of court life, and some excerpts about the life of Buddha Shakyamuni. During the discovery and excavation of the Dong Duong Monastery ruins, archaeologists found many valuable artifacts such as stone Dvarapala statues, stone Buddha statues, stone Siva statues, a bronze Buddha statue (national treasure – housed at the Ho Chi Minh City Museum of History), bronze goddess statues, etc. Most of the sculptures from Dong Duong are displayed at the Cham Museum in Da Nang. The sculptures at Dong Duong formed a famous artistic style from the mid-9th century to the end of the 9th century, known as the Dong Duong style. Dong Duong is a unique Buddhist relic of the Champa kingdom, not only representing Vietnam's cultural heritage but also a rare Buddhist site in the world during ancient and medieval times. Through the remaining artifacts, it reflects the peak era of a monarchy while elevating Cham sculpture art to its pinnacle. From a religious perspective, Dong Duong makes a distinctive contribution to the Buddhist art of humanity, exemplary in its display, in the meaning of statues, reliefs, composition, and is also among the rarest of ancient Buddhist relics remaining today in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. The relics and artifacts at the Dong Duong site showcase the characteristics of a developmental stage of Cham architectural and sculptural art, which scholars have referred to as the Dong Duong artistic style – \"one of the most distinct styles of Cham sculpture art.\" In terms of architecture, researchers have pointed out the basic characteristics of the Dong Duong style, stating, \"... few styles have a clearer personality than the Dong Duong style. It is in this style that the uniqueness and strangeness of Cham art are most clearly expressed.\" Regarding sculpture in architecture, the sculptures of this style are entirely unique. According to researchers, there are three major characteristics to identify the Dong Duong style: the human statues strongly reflect the ethnic characteristics of the Cham people, with thick lips bordered, thick mustaches sometimes obscuring the lips, making the upper lip thicker and longer than the lower lip. The nose is flat and wide. The eyebrows are high and connected. The decorative patterns are often deep leaf motifs that intertwine, creating a distinctive style. Large flowers represent leaf shapes decorating the edges of hats and jewelry; round earrings with large flowers sometimes use snake heads as decorations on jewelry and belts. From the results of research and excavations, it can be affirmed that the Dong Duong artistic style is also present in numerous sculptural architectures in the provinces of Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thua Thien – Hue, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Khanh Hoa… or many different inscriptions in various regions recording this period, such as Ròn Stele (Quang Binh); Nhan Biều Stele (Quang Tri); Phu Luong, Lai Trung Stele (Thua Thien – Hue); Bang An, Bo Mung; Ban Lanh; An Thai; Lac Thanh, Hoa Que (Quang Nam); Chau Sa (Quang Ngai)… demonstrating that the Indrapura dynasty was a prosperous period, developing in many fields across various regions of the Cham people. The characteristics mentioned above are used as criteria to determine the dating and sculptural works of the Cham belonging to the Indrapura period (9th – 10th century). The spread of this artistic period was quite extensive across the territory of the ancient Champa kingdom. The Dong Duong artistic style marks a phase in the development of architecture and art in Vietnam. With its particularly representative values, the archaeological site and artistic architecture of Dong Duong Buddhist Monastery (now part of Dong Duong commune, Da Nang city) has been classified by the Prime Minister as a special national relic (in Decision No. 2499/QĐ-TTg dated December 22, 2016). \n\nReferences: \n1.

    "name": "The Vietnam Hero Mother Statue Complex",
    "description": "The Vietnam Mother Hero Monument Complex is a national cultural work, a sacred symbol that commemorates the great contributions of the Vietnam Mother Heroes during the wars of resistance. Covering an area of over 16 hectares, the Vietnam Mother Hero Monument Complex is located on Mount Cam, Quang Phu Ward, Da Nang City. The project was selected from the sketch of artist Dinh Gia Thang, designed based on the portrait of Mother Nguyen Thi Thu – a mother with 9 sons, 1 son-in-law, and 2 grandsons, all of whom were martyrs in the two wars of resistance. In addition to its outstanding cultural and historical values, this place is also a large-scale sculpture with high artistic value, recognized as a typical architectural work of Da Nang City and the entire country.\n\nMAIN COMPONENTS\nMain monument: The entire monument is made from solid granite blocks, with a total weight of stone and concrete reaching about 20,000 tons. The architecture of the monument takes the shape of a high mountain in the center, gradually lowering on both sides, evoking the idea that “Mother is an endless source, the soul of the nation.” In the center of the monument is a bust of Mother Thu, over 18 meters tall; the two sides of the monument curve outward as if embracing and protecting her children, with the walls depicting the faint silhouettes of children gathered around Mother, symbolizing a peaceful and united country, where descendants from the North, Central, and South gather around their beloved Mother.\n\nVietnam Mother Hero Memorial House: Designed within the main monument, the Vietnam Mother Hero Memorial House has an exhibition space of about 950 m², where nearly 50,000 Vietnam Mother Heroes from across the country are commemorated. Here, visitors can view documentary images, biographies, and artifacts related to the lives and contributions of Vietnamese mothers during the war. Some typical artifacts on display include a copper pot used for cooking rice to supply the troops, a weaving loom from wartime, and a flower vase for worship… realistically depicting the silent sacrifices and noble spirit of the mothers.\n\nTien Mon Square: In front of the monument is a large square that serves as a ceremonial ground, organized in a traditional ritual space with an entrance gate, main axis, and solemn ceremony area. Along the path leading to the monument, there are 30 stone light clusters (and grass carpets) symbolizing 30 years of prolonged resistance, as well as 30 years of waiting for news of husbands and children from the heroic mothers. This square is often used for solemn incense offerings during major commemorative occasions.\n\nWater lake and landscape: In front of the Mother Statue is a large lake with an area of nearly 1,000 m² designed in a semi-circular shape. The monument resembles a mountain rising high in the center and gradually sloping down on both sides. The walls feature the faces of children representing descendants from all regions of the North, Central, and South gathering around their beloved mother, always looking towards her with love, as she seems to open her arms to welcome and embrace her children.\n\nEight legendary pillars: Considered the symbolic gate of the monument, standing 11.2 meters tall and 1.65 meters in diameter, intricately carved with many images. The number 8 signifies prosperity, abundance, and beautiful reunions, corresponding to the eight golden words that Uncle Ho bestowed upon Vietnamese women: “heroic – indomitable – loyal – resourceful.”\n\nOUTSTANDING VALUES OF THE COMPLEX\nThe Vietnam Mother Hero Monument Complex is a “red address,” a place where people across the country turn to express gratitude for the indomitable sacrifices of the nation. The project contributes to educating the younger generation about patriotism, national pride, and the noble tradition of “drinking water, remembering its source” of the Vietnamese people. The stories and artifacts in the museum provide vivid historical lessons, awakening gratitude and national spirit among visitors, especially the younger generation. During commemorative holidays, national and city cultural events are often held here, featuring incense offerings to honor the martyrs and Vietnam Mother Heroes. Additionally, this place has been chosen to host many significant national and city events with large-scale artistic programs, becoming a highlight not only in cultural tourism but also in the spiritual and political life of the local people.\n\nEXPERIENCE ACTIVITIES\nAlong with other popular tourist destinations in the southern part of the city, the Vietnam Mother Hero Monument Complex has become an unmissable destination on the journey back to the roots. At the Monument Complex, visitors can not only explore the architectural works but also have meaningful experiences, listening to touching stories about the silent sacrifices of the mothers for the Fatherland.

    "name": "Sa Huỳnh Cultural Museum Hội An",
    "description": "Located right in the ancient town of Hội An, the Sa Huỳnh Cultural Museum is a unique stop for those who love history and wish to explore the roots of Vietnamese culture. The Sa Huỳnh Museum is a landmark in Quảng Ngãi, and the Sa Huỳnh culture is the common name for the entire cultural heritage in Central Vietnam. This culture spans from Quảng Bình to Ninh Thuận, Bình Thuận and dates back from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD, approximately 2000 years of history. Archaeological discoveries in Hội An such as: Hậu Xá I, Hậu Xá II, An Bàng, Cẩm Phô, Trảng Sỏi, Lăng Bà, Thanh Chiếm, Bãi Ông – Cù Lao Chàm… have shown that the Sa Huỳnh residents once lived, fished, farmed, and engaged in vibrant trade with neighboring regions as well as many cultures outside the area. From these archaeological sites, hundreds of artifacts have been found, revealing a vivid picture of a community with a high level of spiritual, aesthetic, and social organization. To preserve and showcase this valuable collection, the Sa Huỳnh Cultural Museum was established in 1994 and has become one of the first specialized museums on archaeology in Central Vietnam. \n\nThe Sa Huỳnh Cultural Museum impresses with its two-story architecture that bears a strong French influence, both elegant and harmoniously blended into the ancient urban space. It currently houses and displays over 1,000 original artifacts, vividly reflecting the material and spiritual life of the Sa Huỳnh residents. The displayed artifacts are diverse, including everyday items such as pots, dishes, and teapots; as well as agricultural tools associated with ancient farming, fishing, and trading such as hoes, sickles, and knives. Notably, the museum also preserves coins from the Ngũ Thù and Vương Mãn periods of the Han Dynasty (China), demonstrating the early economic and cultural exchanges between the Sa Huỳnh residents and neighboring areas. Additionally, the collection of jewelry from the Sa Huỳnh residents showcases refined aesthetic standards and skilled craftsmanship, made from stone, agate, and various precious minerals. The most prominent pieces include three-pronged earrings, hoop earrings, and unique beaded jewelry. Sa Huỳnh ceramics are an important highlight of the museum, featuring a variety of forms from pots, bowls, and plates to teapots decorated with intricate embossed and engraved patterns, reflecting the rich aesthetic taste and spiritual life of the ancient residents. Particularly, the jar tombs – a distinctive burial form of the Sa Huỳnh people – are displayed here in various shapes: oval, egg-shaped, cylindrical, with or without lids. Through this, viewers can observe clear signs of social stratification at that time – indicative of the formation of social classes and primitive management institutions. All the artifacts displayed at the Sa Huỳnh Cultural Museum are not only compelling evidence of a brilliant historical period but also contribute to clarifying the ancient civilization in Hội An in particular and Central Vietnam in general – a place where cultural, artistic, and intellectual values of our ancestors have converged and crystallized for thousands of years.\n\n**Essential Information**  \nAddress: 149 Trần Phú, Hội An Ward, Da Nang City  \nOpening hours: 07:00 – 21:00 (closed on the 10th of each month)  \nTicket price: Included in the ticket for visiting the ancient town (Ticket price for the ancient town: Price for Vietnamese visitors: 80,000 VND/person.

    "description": "The Da Nang City Memorial is a place that honors the heroes and martyrs who fell in the great war of the nation. This site is often a stop for tourists visiting Da Nang on their journey to explore the culture and history of this land. A PLACE TO REMEMBER THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE Our country – A nation that throughout its history has always been associated with the cause of building and defending the country, has witnessed a generation of people willing to sacrifice their personal interests for the common good of the nation. During that prolonged resistance period, those who fell before were succeeded by those who rose up; countless Vietnamese people have laid down their lives on this land. Blood and bones have soaked into every inch of the homeland from North to South. A PLACE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO EXPRESS GRATITUDE TO THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE The peace we enjoy today is the result of the sacrifices made by an entire generation. In keeping with this tradition, in the heroic land of Da Nang – the birthplace of brave and resilient children – 27 cemeteries and memorials have been established, among which the City Memorial for Heroes and Martyrs is one of the most prominent works. The City Memorial for Heroes and Martyrs is familiar to the people of Da Nang by the name 2/9 Monument. When traveling to Da Nang, the city’s memorial for heroes and martyrs, also known as the 2-9 Monument, is an architectural site with historical significance that you should visit. Not only is it beautifully designed and rich in humanity, but bowing to light an incense stick at the memorial is also a way for Vietnamese people to express their gratitude to the previous generation. The architecture of the 2-9 Monument The 2/9 Monument is situated in a beautiful location. Behind it flows the poetic Han River, creating a cool, quiet, and solemn space. In front is a long road named 2/9 – a brilliant milestone of the Vietnamese nation. The area in front of the monument is very spacious and often hosts major events of the city. The 2-9 Monument is a synthesis of ideas from architect Pham Sy Chuc and sculptor Pham Van Hang, along with the late painter and sculptor Do Toan. The monument's main structure consists of three wings forming a tripod that converges and rises high, creating a solid and imposing stance amidst the sky and earth. The creative points in the architecture and design of the monument are not only reflected in the lines of the base and body of the statue but also in the integrated functional structure of the pedestal. Beneath the soaring architecture of the statue, a solemn space is constructed to hold incense burners, wreaths, and to commemorate the heroes and martyrs. In the center, on the conical ceiling, images of soldiers holding guns, sacrificing themselves for the country, are shaped by hundreds of thousands of unique ceramic pieces. The phrase “The Fatherland remembers” is placed vertically in the middle of the monument's body, adding dignity and grandeur to the structure while expressing deep gratitude to the generations of ancestors who bravely sacrificed in wars against foreign invaders, bringing peace and independence to the nation. In August 2024, the Da Nang City People's Committee will hold a ceremony to inaugurate the upgraded and restored City Memorial and to renovate and expand the 29/3 Square. The project to upgrade and restore the city memorial and to renovate and expand the 29-3 Square has a total investment of over 212 billion VND from the city budget and socialization; it was started in 2022 and is divided into two phases. In phase 1, the city memorial will be upgraded, a new relief will be created, and the landscape, foundation, and lighting system will be improved. Phase 2 will involve constructing the technical infrastructure around the memorial and the square, highlighted by an artistic water fountain. This project is a heartfelt tribute from the people, soldiers, and officials of the city to remember the contributions of the heroes and martyrs who sacrificed in the struggle to build and protect the city.

    "description": "Mân Quang Communal House is currently located in Mân Quang II neighborhood, Hòa Quý ward, Ngũ Hành Sơn district, Da Nang city. 1. Name: Mân Quang Communal House. 2. Location and directions: Mân Quang Communal House is currently located in Mân Quang II neighborhood, Hòa Quý ward, Ngũ Hành Sơn district, Da Nang city. It is about 6km southwest of the Ngũ Hành Sơn scenic area. 3. Type of monument: Mân Quang Communal House is a historical monument. 4. Description of the monument: Mân Quang Communal House was destroyed by invaders in 1972. The villagers of Mân Quang worked together to rebuild a new communal house to worship the deity and the ancestors, as well as those who contributed to the homeland and country. The house was inaugurated on December 21, 2003, using modern materials and reinforced concrete structure, but in the old style. The house measures 12.34m in length and 8.15m in width on a site of 696m. It is built facing northwest, consisting of a main hall with 3 compartments and 2 wings, and a rear altar. In front of the house are two large stone pillars, each topped with a lion statue. On either side are smaller pillars, each featuring a wine gourd. Next is a screen wall 2m high and 2.5m wide. The front of the screen wall is adorned with two cranes standing on a turtle. The inner side features a dragon horse, all made from ceramic pieces. On either side of the communal house are two small shrines, the right shrine worships a general from the Nguyễn clan, and the left shrine worships a general from the Võ clan. According to legend, these are the two generals who defeated the sea monster that troubled the lives of the local residents. The steps leading up to the front hall have two round columns decorated with two coiling dragons. The two columns at the ends of the eaves are square and have couplets inscribed on them. Previously, the old communal house had four green stone columns inscribed with four couplets. Currently, the house still retains two eaves columns made of green stone. Inside the house, the rear altar worships the village's tutelary god. The left and right sides are dedicated to the ancestors. The roof of the communal house is tiled, and the rear altar has its own roof. The ridge is decorated with the motif of \"two dragons worshiping the sun.\" The ends of the roof are adorned with two phoenixes. In the center above the eaves is inscribed \"Mân Quang Communal House.\" On either side are two turtles. All these decorative items are made from ceramic pieces. The eaves are fitted with a row of small blue-glazed plates. At both ends of the steps are two large lion statues. The courtyard of the communal house has been paved with cement. A fence has also been built around the house. The house is situated in the middle of a field, making it very airy on all four sides. 6. Artifacts in the monument: The communal house has been burned and plowed multiple times, so the worship items and royal decrees have been lost. Currently, the house retains 3 royal decrees from the Đinh, Lê, and Trần clans dating back to the second year of Khải Định (1917). 7. Forms of cultural activities, folk traditions, and festivals: Every year, the villagers hold a prayer ceremony for peace on the 10th day of the 3rd lunar month. All offerings for the ceremonies are contributed by the villagers. 8. Historical, scientific, artistic, and cultural value: Although the communal house was destroyed during the war and many artifacts were lost, the clans still retain 3 royal decrees for the ancestors. Additionally, the clans have preserved a funeral poem. A special feature of Mân Quang Communal House is that it includes the name of the Hero of the People's Armed Forces Trần Minh Thiệt, who was a major general and deputy chief of staff of Military Region V, in the funeral poem. This reflects the villagers' deep gratitude and remembrance for those who contributed to the homeland, regardless of the era they lived in. The newly built communal house also has an inscription about the journey of the ancestors to this land, which has been translated into Vietnamese. The reconstruction of the new communal house in 2003 also demonstrates profound gratitude towards the predecessors, despite the economic difficulties faced by the villagers of Mân Quang. This is also a beautiful tradition that all residents of the village are obliged to continue and pass on to future generations. DA NANG MUSEUM OF CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT BOARD",

    "name": "Hòa Bắc Gươl House",
    "description": "In the area of Da Nang City, the Co Tu community primarily resides in the villages of Ta Lang, Gian Bi (Hoa Bac commune) and Phu Tuc (Hoa Phu commune). Among them, the two villages of Ta Lang and Gian Bi have more than 250 Co Tu households. The Gươl house in the two villages of Ta Lang and Gian Bi (Hoa Bac commune, Hoa Vang district) serves the needs of tourists to visit, enjoy various forms of traditional culture, and display the most important traditional Co Tu crafts during festivals and holidays. For the Co Tu people, the Gươl house is the communal house of the village, where it is not only a sacred living space but also considered the soul of the village. Here, one can clearly see the talents of folk artisans and the multi-dimensional cultural values of the Co Tu people. The Gươl is a place to worship the folk deities, ancestors, and forefathers of the Co Tu. The Gươl house preserves common treasures and wealth, serves as a meeting place, for rituals, performances of various art forms, and folk games. According to Elder Alăng Mỹ (64 years old, residing in Ta Lang village, Hoa Bac commune), the Co Tu people believe that the Gươl house is a sacred place where deities, ancestors, and forefathers reside. Inside the Gươl, people are not allowed to argue but must always unite, support, and love one another for the survival and development of their lineage. On the roof of the Gươl house, at both gable ends, there are statues of roosters, symbolizing the creature that awakens people each morning. The roof is thatched with palm leaves or nipa leaves. The Gươl house is built in the style of a stilt house, with one main pillar (father pillar) in the center and eight smaller pillars surrounding it, connected to form a sturdy system. The main pillar plays a very important role, symbolizing the backbone of the village elder. The more beautiful and taller the pillar, the more it represents the authority of the village elder and the strength of that village. Nowadays, the Co Tu have replaced wooden pillars with concrete pillars and painted them to look like wood. The Co Tu people believe that the tring bird is the messenger of the Rice God, guiding them to find new land for cultivation and establishing villages. Therefore, on the main pillar, there are carvings of a pair of tring birds and a rooster, representing beauty, the connection between humans and nature, and the desire for fertility and a happy life. The crossbeams are decorated with patterns, motifs, and images of daily life in the community such as: young men hunting, young women dancing tung tung da dá, gong performances, and rice pounding… which help embellish the interior of the house, showcasing the unique culture of the Co Tu people. Particularly, in the past, when the Co Tu went hunting in the forest, they would bring back animal skulls or buffalo skulls after the sacrifice ceremony to hang on the walls, pillars, and beams of the Gươl house. Inside the Gươl is a place to worship the deities according to the folk beliefs of the Co Tu, with hopes for favorable weather, bountiful harvests, and good fortune for the villagers. Also, right in the middle of the main pillar, the community carves the image of a mortar symmetrically on the top and bottom. This image symbolizes both abundance and fertility. Among them, the most important part is the mirror, which is attached symmetrically with two thin wooden panels carved with the image of a pair of tring birds and a rooster. This symbolizes the two arms of a Co Tu woman dancing the tung tung da dá, offering to the Rice God and the Sky God everything they have produced. The sculptures and the long-standing culture preserved in the community's house have made the Gươl house a familiar, close image and a source of pride for the Co Tu people. It helps future generations understand and inherit the material and spiritual cultural values of their ethnicity. \n\nTHE MEANING OF THE “TUNG TUNG DA ZÁ” DANCE OF THE CO TU PEOPLE\nThe “Tung tung da zá” dance, also known as the (heavenly offering dance), has been closely linked to the spiritual life of the Co Tu for generations. No Co Tu person, whether in Quang Nam, Da Nang, or distant Thua Thien Hue, is unfamiliar with this dance. The movements in the Tung tung da zá dance mimic the daily labor and activities of the Co Tu people such as rice harvesting, fishing, hunting, and various festivals. The “Tung tung da zá” dance is often performed during community gatherings, at festivals, buffalo stabbing ceremonies, new rice celebrations, village establishment, Gươl house construction, and friendship ceremonies between villages, as a way for the Co Tu to connect with the universe, ancestors, and deities, expressing their reverence and gratitude towards those who cleared the land and established villages. “Tung tung” is the dance of men, symbolizing rising high, strength, stability, and valor, expressing the desire to conquer the universe and the wish for a better life. Meanwhile, “da zá” is the dance of women, symbolizing straightness and rhythm, embodying the spiritual aspiration of honoring the earth and sky, loyalty, and respect for hierarchy. In the vast space of the mountains and forests, along with the sounds of gongs and other traditional instruments, the “Tung tung da zá” dance serves as a prayer from the Co Tu to the deities and ancestors.
